The pushbutton_irq_handler is a kernel module designed to handle interrupts generated by the pushbuttons of the DE1-SoC. The FPGA must be programmed with the DE1_SoC_Computer.rbf system (which is programmed by default upon booting). When the module is first loaded, the LEDs get set to 0x200, which turns on the leftmost LED. The module registers an interrupt handler function that listens for interrupts coming from the pushbutton (interrupt is generated whenever a button is pressed) and increments the value displayed on the LEDs by 1. 

To compile the kernel module use the following command:

  make

To run the module (insert the module into the kernel):

  insmod pushbutton_irq_handler.ko

To stop the module (remove from kernel):

  rmmod pushbutton_irq_handler
